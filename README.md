This assignment that I did when I undertook Data Science Certificate Program.

The classification that is using in this assignment is classification, namely KNN model and SVM model.

The assignment has two parts, the first is using the two train and test data to predict how expensive a phone can be based on the features that are given to the phone.

The second is to predict whether a patient will get diabetes based on the patient's medical histories and family records, 0 means the patient will less likely get diabetes while 1 
means the patient has diabetes.
